# dra-driver-topology

This repository contains a reference resource driver implemented as a Kubernetes controller to expose topological node information against Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) APIs.

# Development

You can run the controller locally with `make run`. You must specify
`--apiserver-endpoint` or `--kubeconfig` to an `ARGS` environment variable to
give it access to a control plane. For example:

```
make run ARGS="--apiserver-endpoint=https://127.0.0.1:46777 --v 5"
```

## Updating tool dependencies

Go tools in this repo are experimentally being managed using a separate module
file and the `go tool` command (new as of Go 1.24) in such a way as to isolate
the tool dependencies from the project dependencies.

To update the separate go.mod file properly, run go get with the -tool option
and the correct -modfile target, for example:

```
# Update golangci-lint
go get -tool -modfile=golangci-lint.mod github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
```
